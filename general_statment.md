# FitChallenge – Course Project

## Introduction

In this course project, students will work in groups of up to **3 people** to design and implement a web application using **Ruby on Rails**.  
The goal is to create **FitChallenge**: a web application where users can create, join, and track progress on fitness or habit challenges.  
Each challenge has a **creator**, **participants**, and **progress entries** with points contributing to rankings.  
The system encourages engagement through gamification elements such as **leaderboards**, **badges**, and optional **notifications**.

---

## Project Overview

The web application you will develop throughout this course aims to provide a dynamic platform where users can:

-   Create, join, and track progress in fitness or habit-based challenges.
-   Set clear goals, durations, and point systems that reward consistent participation.
-   Earn points and climb leaderboards that foster friendly competition and motivation.

### Core User Experience

-   Users start by **creating an account** and securely logging in.
-   Once authenticated, they can **browse existing challenges**, **join those that interest them**, and **record their progress** (daily or weekly).
-   The system **automatically updates leaderboards** to display top participants.
-   Users can **create their own challenges**, defining:
    -   Challenge name and description
    -   Start and end dates
    -   Point allocation rules

This flexibility allows the platform to **grow organically**, with users adding new and creative challenges for others to join.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system includes **role-based access control**:

-   **Administrators** – manage platform-wide settings and ensure community guidelines are followed.
-   **Challenge Creators** – control the challenges they design.
-   **Participants** – join and track progress in challenges.

### Design and User Experience

The interface should be **clean, intuitive, and responsive**.  
Key UI/UX features include:

-   Filters or categories to find challenges quickly.
-   Detailed challenge pages showing participant rankings.
-   Easy-to-use progress logging.
-   Visual clarity and consistent design for engagement.

### Technical Foundations

The platform will be built with **Ruby on Rails**, following:

-   **MVC architecture**
-   **Best practices** for maintainable and scalable code
-   Incremental implementation through multiple assignments

Development stages include:

1. Data modeling and user stories
2. CRUD operations and validations
3. Authentication and authorization
4. Final deployment and polish

The final result should be a **fully functional, secure, and engaging web application** that reflects modern web development standards.

## Project Requirements

This project will be developed across **four checkpoints**, leading to a **final submission**.

### Checkpoints

| Assignment   | Due Date                     | Description                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Assignment 1 | Tuesday, September 23rd      | Initial data modeling and user stories     |
| Assignment 2 | Tuesday, October 7th         | Rails application and database integration |
| Assignment 3 | Tuesday, October 28th        | Advanced functionality and validations     |
| Assignment 4 | Tuesday, November 18th       | Final features, polish, and presentation   |
| **Demo**     | **Wednesday, November 26th** | **Final project presentation (mandatory)** |

Each assignment and the final demo carry a **weight of 20%** toward the **final project grade**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Attendance at the demo is **mandatory**.  
> If your group fails to present the demo, the project will be **considered failed**, regardless of prior progress.

---

## Final Submission

The final submission must include:

-   A **fully working version** of the application
-   A **short presentation** explaining the project
-   A **live demo** walking through the app, structure, and features
-   **Clean, well-documented code** following standard coding conventions

---

**FitChallenge** challenges you to build something that’s not only functional and secure but also **fun, motivating, and user-centered** — reflecting the real-world demands of modern web development.
